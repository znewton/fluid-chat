        It includes some helpful tools to debug and reproduce various scenarios.

            <strong>Message Input (bottom):</strong>

          <p>
            Type something here then press "Enter" or click the "
            <RiSendPlaneFill /> Send" icon (bottom right) to send a message.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a low-level, this sends an individual "op" by adding a string
            value to an array within a "messages" key in a SharedMap object.
            Plain text messages here will continue to increase the size of the
            main DDS, which can be useful for generating larger and larger ops.

            text generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Useful when trying to simply validate that ops are flowing across
            clients.

            Generates a random conversation, 1 message per 400ms, continuously,
            until clicked again. Each message has 1% chance to be 700kb, 10%
            chance to be 200kb, and 89% chance to be small.

            Useful for generating mild load while multitasking or monitoring
            something else, like memory consumption.

            Adding strings to an array is pretty limiting for reproducing
            various user scenarios. Several tools have been added to the "
            <RiToolsFill /> Tools" menu to the left of the input bar. Click the
            "
            <RiToolsFill /> Tools" menu button to view a complete list of
            special utilities and their main usecases.

            <strong>Connection timer (top right):</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Useful for tracking durations of connected/disconnected states. This
            is particularly helpful when trying to time events like session end
            (10 minutes disconnected) or monitoring how long it takes to join a
            session.

            By default, you will see one chat window. To add another chat client
            in the same window, click the "<RiUserAddFill />
            &nbsp; Add Client" button in the top right.
          </p>
          <p>
            To establish a read-only client, click the "<RiUserAddFill />
            &nbsp; Add Read Client".
